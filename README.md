# TriviaAppConsole

TriviaAppConsole is a program created in the Java programming language in the console version. This is a simple quiz-type game. After starting the game, the user can choose the number of questions (from 1 to 50), the level of difficulty of the questions (easy, medium, difficult, any), the type of questions (selection from many, true/false or any) and the category of questions using numbers from 1 to 25. During the game, the user can go to the next question, return to the previous question and end the game at any time. After completing the quiz, the user is informed about the result obtained (number of points obtained), as well as information about which answers were correct and which were marked. At the end of the quiz, the application gives the user the option to continue the game (another quiz) or exit the program.
